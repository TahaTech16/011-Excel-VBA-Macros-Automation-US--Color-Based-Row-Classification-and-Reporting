### **Project Title:**

**011 – Excel VBA Macros Automation (US) – Color-Based Row Classification and Reporting**

### **Description:**

Developed an Excel VBA solution to automate reporting based on the **row color formatting** applied by users. The tool was designed to:

* Identify and categorize data rows based on their **background fill color** (e.g., red = urgent, green = completed, yellow = pending)
* Automate the **extraction and consolidation** of color-coded rows into separate summary reports
* Generate dynamic counts and totals based on color classification
* Enable users to easily update formatting, and have the report auto-refresh accordingly
* Reduce manual work in sorting and filtering large datasets for reporting
* Tailored for **U.S.-based clients**, ensuring localized formatting (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, \$ currency)

**Objective:**
To enhance visibility into task status or data categories by utilizing color-coded logic for fast, automated reporting and decision-making.
